## Description
A configureable table that displays arrays of objects in a table format with rows of data.

The widget is configureable to allow for custom functionality. A `buttons` property provides this capability. When the button is clicked, the eventName is dispatched. In this way, it can be configured to emit any event and display a button with any icon.

## Example

@demo sp-list-table/demo/demo.html 500
